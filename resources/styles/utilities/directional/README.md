BpDirectional is a renderless Vue component that implements keyboard navigation for elements within it. This includes arrow keys as well as Home and End.

Keyboard navigation is done based on _screen layout_ - that means that even if content reflows based on breakpoints, directional keys should still move focus how the user would expect.
