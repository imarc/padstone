The container class is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Boilerplate. Instead of container, use `.grid` with `.grid__container` or the mixin.

The container class has been updated to use the responsive `$gap` sizes so it will correctly match how `.grid__container` looks across all breakpoints.
