This is a Vue Component, BpCarousel, that's a wrapper for Swiper. It provides a
couple sets of default functionality for Swiper, but for advanced carousels you
should use Swiper directly.

BpCarousel takes a single prop, `variant`. Beyond the default appearance, you
cant set `variant="bleedRight"` to switch to config settings appropriate for a
slider that starts centered and bleeds right.
