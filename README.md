# Padstone for Craft CMS

Padstone is a starter package for Craft 3 built by Imarc. It provides a simple project config as well as example entries and templates.

_If you would like to use the older version of Padstone for Craft 2, see the [craft2 branch](https://github.com/imarc/padstone/tree/craft2)._

## Features

* Pre-built CMS sections, including ones for the Homepage, a Blog, News, and Resources. (18 in total!)
* A set of [Imarc Boilerplate](https://github.com/imarc/boilerplate-components) twig templates for you to replace or customize.
* A neo-based **Content Designer** field, built within Craft, for laying out pages beyond simple rich text.
* A set of plugins selected by Imarc that we recommend for new projects.


## Getting Started

Create a new padstone project with the following [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) command:

```sh
composer create-project imarc/padstone [folder]
```

### Using [ops](https://github.com/imarc/ops) (the fast way)

Go into your the new project folder, and run

```sh
ops padstone-install
```

This will run all the following steps, including prompting you for values to add to your .env file. You likely want to leave DB_SERVER as `mariadb` (the default), but you can change the other settings if you'd like.


### The manual way

0. Copy .env.example to be .env and update settings inside. In particular, DB_DATABASE, DB_SERVER, DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD.
0. Run `./craft setup/security-key` to generate a SECURITY_KEY for your .env file.
0. If you'd like to use Padstone's SQL file, import padstone.sql into your site.
0. The default Padstone site is configured to [store user sessions in the database](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/config/app.html#session-component). The phpsessions table needs to be added to the new database. If you import the padstone.sql file the table will be created by the import. As an alternative, you can create the table manually by runnng the craft console command.

    craft setup/php-session-table

Then run the installer by going to /admin (except for your domain.)

## Logging in

If you use the ops method or import `padstone.sql` manually, the username is *admin* and the password is *padstone*. Please change the password after you first login.


## Front-End Build

Beyond the typical craft files, you will also see a resources/ folder. Padstone
uses [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com/docs/4.0/basic-example) to compile JS and Sass files from the resources/ folder and store the results into the public/ folder:

* `resources/assets/sass/main.scss` is compiled to `public/css/main.css`
* `resources/assets/js/main.js` is compiled to `public/js/main.js`

Additionally, Padstone produces `manifest.js` and `vendor.js` files that
must be included, in that order, before any of your own JS files. You can
customize this behavior in `webpack.mix.js`.

### Watching/Building assets

While developing, you most likely want to watch the files you are working on,
so the build happens automatically after every save.

    npm run watch

If you want to run this same build process for dev without watching, you can
run the following:

    npm run dev

If you are building to production, run:

    npm run prod

### Macros

There is a `_macros.twig` file that provides The following macros:

* **renderAllBlocks**, **renderBlock**, and **renderColumn** - these are used to render the contentDesigner field.
* **responsiveImage** - macro that uses the responsiveImage.twig partial to embed an image with an appropriate picture tag with srcsets for working with lazysizes.
* **pagination** - used to generate pagination.
* **commaSeparate** - used to generate a comma separated list of elements based on title.
* **columnsSlug** - used to generate a classname appropriate slug for for a section.
* **numberToWord** - used to convert a number from 0 through 10 to an english word.


### Sections

The **Content Designer** Field (contentDesigner) allows CMS users to use the following sections out of the box:

* **Designed Section** - the most common section, it allows you to pick a combination of up to two columns to render together out of the following:
  * Text - a regular rich text column. Within a Text column, you can additionally add a Call to Action.
  * Call to Action - a call to action, typically styled to look like a button.
  * Image - an image.
  * Related Entry - a related entry.
  * Testimonial - a testimonial.
  * Video - a video.
  * Embed - an embed.
* **Rich Text Section** - a more traditional section of just rich text, relying on redactor for styling or floating images within the content.
* **Call to Action Section** - A full width section featuring a call to action.
* **Related Entries Section** - A section of related entries, such as related blog articles or resources.
* **Testimonial Section** - A section featuring a testimonial.
* **Icon Grid Section** - An icon grid, typically used to showcase partner, brand or technology logos.
* **Shared Section** - allows you to include a Shared Section, a separate type of entry in the CMS that itself contains a Content Designer field. This lets you build a block once (within a Shared Section) and include it into multiple pages on the site.
